# Bataan's Missing Person - Web Application

<h3>About the Project</h3>

This application aims to help in information dissemination for people who are missing in a certain area, for example the province of Bataan. 
People can post a report about a missing person here and track for updates if someone sees them or found them. Users can also report if they saw a missing person. This application makes it easier to track the progress of a missing person's report.
  


<h3>Key Features</h3>
